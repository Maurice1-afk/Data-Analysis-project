#COVID-19 Global Data Tracker Project

In this project, I have build a data analysis and reporting notebook (or app) that tracks global COVID-19 trends. The project analyzes cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across countries and time.

 #Project Objectives:

Import and clean COVID-19 global data
Analyze time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations)
Compare metrics across countries/regions
Visualize trends with charts and maps
Communicate findings in a Jupyter Notebook or PDF report 


#List of tools and libraries used:

Jupyter Notebook (or VS Code with Jupyter extension)
Pandas
Matplotlib & seaborn
